# Fractal Tree Visualizer

Demo: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/750989

Draws a fractal tree based on the number of child branches that split off from each parent branch, the size that each child branch will be compared to its parent branch, the minimum branch length the program draws, and the angle between branches.
