# Fractal Tree Visualizer

Demo: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/750989

This program takes four values as input, separated by commas. The first value is the number of child branches that split off from each parent branch, the second is the size that the child branches will be when compared to their parent branch, the third is the minimum branch length the program draws, and the fourth is the angle between branches. The angle can also be changed by clicking and dragging the mouse across the screen.
